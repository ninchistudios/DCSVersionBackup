# DCSVersionBackup
Tool to easily backup DCS before an update
Backs up DCS World folder, DCS folder in saved games, helios & jsgme folders if you have them to a location of your choice.
Only writing it because im too lazy to copy all the folders manually for the countless updates we have.
Handy if an error occurs just replace the original folders with the folders you backed up to roll back to the original version
Layout is awful, just slapped together..May add restore functionality later... though for the few times ive had to copy them back it may not be worth it. May add voice attack and Trackir backup into it later too just to save time.

TO Do.. 
need to do it properly really, sort out bindings etc and sort out UI.. then again it works just to save time doing it manually.
